\mainpage Documentation of the SQLite cache database schema

\section baf2sql Philosophy behind BAF2SQL

BAF2SQL enables read-only access to the data in a BAF file through two
layers: an SQLite database "cache", and a binary storage interface.

<ul>

<li>Metadata describing the spectra and the acquisition are available
through an SQLite database. The database schema is documented
here. This SQLite database will be generated automatically for each
BAF; see the documentation of the language binding (C++, C, C#) you
are going to use.

<li>The actual spectrum data, i.e. any stored arrays of binary data,
only have a 64-bit integer ID in the SQL database. Using this ID,
you can retrieve the actual data using the binary storage interface
using a function such as readArrayData(); see the documentation of
the language binding (C++, C, C#) you are going to use.

</ul>

Auto-generated HTML documentation for the SQL database schema is not
available unfortunately; for an explanation of the tables and their
fields please look at the source code of this file (schema.h).

\section notes Notes on the array IDs

The nine IDs (starting with ProfileMzId) in the Spectra table are
integers using which you can retrieve the actual array data from the
binary storage interface functions.

Note: array IDs are 64-bit unsigned integers in general - when using
the C++ interface 'CppSQLite3' for SQLite, this requires you to use
boost::lexical_cast<uint64_t> on the result of
CppSQLite3Query::fieldValue() to extract this number from a row.

Some of the ID fields in a row may not be set (i.e., NULL), indicating
that there is no corresponding array in the BAF file. However, even if
the field is set to some integer number, when you go to the binary
storage and ask for the corresponding array, it might turn out to have
length zero, even though other arrays corresponding to the same
spectrum may have non-empty arrays (i.e., LineIndexId may be
non-empty, but LineSnrId might be empty). This is normal behaviour and
simply means that during acquisition no SNR was recorded. For
performance reasons we decided to not clear the corresponding ID field
in the row from the beginning (this would require scanning the entire
BAF file).

Never try to interpret the ID. It is an opaque handle, and you should
only use it to go to the read_array() functions.

Don't expect that the ID will remain constant forever. If you open the
same BAF the next day, the ID might have changed (especially when this
schema changes). Just take the ID from the fresh SQLite cache, then
get the array with it; don't store the ID in your application.

\section general General notes

There may be more tables in the actual database than documented
here. This should not disturb you.

A table may have more columns than documented below (e.g., for
internal prototyping). This should not disturb you. Be careful when
using "SELECT *" statements; don't expect specific columns at specific
indices in that case.

You should not try to modify the database yourself. It is read-only
for you.
